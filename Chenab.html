    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Chenab Bridge stands as an engineering masterpiece, a testament to human ingenuity in the face of nature's formidable challenges. Situated in the rugged terrain of the Himalayas, it's a vital link in the ambitious USBRL project. Its record-breaking height and complex construction have drawn global attention.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Construction Aspects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Foundation Engineering:</strong> The foundations were designed to withstand extreme loads and seismic forces. Deep bored pile foundations were used, reaching depths of over 100 meters in some areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Steel Arch Design:</strong> The arch is a two-ribbed steel structure, designed to distribute loads evenly. The steel was specially alloyed to resist corrosion and extreme temperatures (-10°C to 40°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Piers:</strong> The concrete piers supporting the arch are designed to withstand significant vertical and lateral loads. High-performance concrete was used to ensure durability and strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Fabrication and Transportation:</strong> The steel segments were fabricated in workshops and transported to the site using specialized heavy-duty vehicles and river barges.</li>
        <li><strong>Erection Methodology:</strong> The arch was erected using a combination of self-propelled gantries, cable cranes, and temporary support structures. Precision was paramount, with tolerances measured in millimeters.</li>
        <li><strong>Welding Technology:</strong> Advanced welding techniques, including submerged arc welding and flux-cored arc welding, were used to ensure the integrity of the steel structure. Non-destructive testing was conducted to verify weld quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrosion Protection System:</strong> A multi-layered corrosion protection system was applied to the steel, including thermal spray aluminum, epoxy coatings, and weather-resistant paint.</li>
        <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Over 1,200 sensors were installed to monitor the bridge's structural behavior, including strain, displacement, temperature, and wind speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Construction Safety:</strong> Stringent safety protocols were implemented to protect workers, given the challenging terrain and extreme heights.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> The remote location posed significant logistical challenges, requiring careful planning and coordination of material and equipment delivery.</li>
    </ul>
